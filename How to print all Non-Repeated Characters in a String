Explanation:

#include <iostream> and #include <map>: These lines include the necessary header files for input and output operations (iostream) and for using the map container from the Standard Library (map).

using namespace std;: This line allows you to use components from the std namespace (such as map, cout, cin, etc.) without prefixing them with std::.

void printNonRepeatedCharacters(const string& str) { ... }: This function takes a constant reference to a string as input and prints all non-repeated characters in the string.

map<char, int> charCount;: This line declares a map named charCount where the keys are characters (char) and the values are integers (int). It is used to store the count of each character in the input string.

for (char ch : str) { ... }: This loop iterates through the characters of the input string (str). For each character, it increments the count in the charCount map.

for (char ch : str) { ... }: After counting the occurrences, this loop iterates through the characters of the input string again. If the count of a character is 1, it means the character is non-repeated, and it is printed.

int main() { ... }: In the main function, the user is prompted to enter a string. The printNonRepeatedCharacters function is then called with the input string, and it prints all non-repeated characters in the input string.

When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a string and then print all non-repeated characters in the input string.
